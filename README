Ntex is a tool for making super-fast notes in LaTeX. Writing is almost as distract-free as editing a simple text file, but ntex file can be converted to *.tex file and then to *.pdf.

With this project in path you just du:
	-mkdir myNotes
	-cd myNotes
	-ntex generate
	-ntex help  		[for information about formating]
	-vi notes.ntex 		[edit the file]
	-./compile			[build the pdf file and open it]



-------------------------------
Commands:
	ntex generate 			[copies all files necessary and generates notes.ntex with MANY information]
	ntex gen				[does the same byt generates SMALL notes.ntex file with basic structure]
	ntex init				[just copies files, create your own notes.ntex file]
	ntex help				[print help and formatting info]

-------------------------------
Notes: 
	-project is written in java in eclipse and uses gradle
	-basic usage of gradle:
		./gradlew out  		[builds jar file, which is deployed under 'build/install...']
		./gradlew eclipse 	[rebuilds eclipse project]
	-all files copied by 'ntex generate' can be found in folder 'app' 	[you have to move jar file to position after rebuilding]
