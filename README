Ntex is a tool for making super-fast notes in LaTeX. 
Writing is almost as distract-free as editing a simple text file, 
but ntex file can be converted to *.tex file and then to *.pdf.
User can make sections, subsections, bulleted lists citations
and add figures in simplified way. 
Also, the rest of LaTeX tags is supported.
