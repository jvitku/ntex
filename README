Ntex is a tool for making super-fast notes in LaTeX. 
Writing is almost as distract-free as editing a simple text file, 
but ntex file can be converted to *.tex file and then to *.pdf.
User can make sections, subsections, bulleted lists, citations
and add figures in a simplified way. 
Also, the rest of LaTeX commands is supported.

------------------------------- Usage:

With this project in path you just do the following:
	- add app/ntex script to your $PATH
	
	- mkdir myNote && cd myNote
	- ntex generate	[init the folder]
	- ntex help  	[for information about formatting]
	- vi notes.ntex [edit the file]
	- ./compile		[build the pdf file and open it]


------------------------------- Commands:

	ntex initialize [copies all files in the place and generates notes.ntex ~ demo]
	ntex init		[the same, but generates notes.ntex containing just basic structure]
	ntex help		[print help and formatting info]
	./compile		[create and open pdf document from the notes.ntex file]

------------------------------- Notes: 

	-project is written in java as an eclipse project and uses gradle: http://www.gradle.org/
	-basic usage of gradle:
		./gradlew installApp [builds application, jar file (under 'build/install...') is used]
		./gradlew eclipse 	 [rebuilds eclipse project]
		./gradkew test 		 [runs tests]
	-all files copied by 'ntex generate' can be found in folder 'app' except jar file (see above)
	-only Unix systems supported so far
	
	-the script ntex (application) uses:
	 	-jar file to convert ntex -> latex
		-pdflatex command (part of LaTeX installation) to convert latex->pdf
		-Okular or Preview to open/reload the resulting pdf
